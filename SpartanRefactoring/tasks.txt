* Move to Maven
* Move to org.spartan
* Use hamcrest
* Added general purpose utility classes for hamcerst
* Added general purpose utility classes under org.spartan.util
* Added utility classes for JDT: Is, Make, All, Have, As, Are and Funcs.
* Around 2000 unit tests
* Introduced the "wring" technology; currently all packed under one sprartanization, which is not active yet.

Bug introduced:
* Broke the shortest operand first code (does not sort remaining arguments)
* Broke the plugin semantics.
* Maven still produces errors.

Todos:
* Hack the unit tests so that they work.
* Make the plugin work again; do not worry about wrings.
* List of safe and sane operations: comparison with boolean, literal ordering, simplify negation, ternarize, chain, shortest branch
* Add safe operations as cleanup operations
